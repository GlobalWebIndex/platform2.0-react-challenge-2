The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Extra libraries

Animations were made with Motion Framer (HomePage, Breeds Page)
Given the amount of the results, pagination was used to separate results that were extracted from API in each page. 

##### CSS and SCSS 
SCSS was used and ClassNames were given with BEM (Block Element Modifier) method.
Layout is consistent through the pages, but different classes were given to each page in order to create different hover effects for each card.
