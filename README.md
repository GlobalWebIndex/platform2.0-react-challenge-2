<h1 align="center">DogLover (GWI challenge)</h1>

<br />

# Tech Stack
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React Paginate](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate#readme)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

# Features
## First view (home)
- Shows a random image. Has a button to refresh the component.
**Breed name under image.**
**URL input field and copy-to-clipboard button.**
**Link to Wikipedia breed page. (Results may vary depending on the country your IP is located, as this uses Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button to work.**
**Link to view gallery of breed.**

## Second view (all breeds)
- Shows a list of all dog breeds, each with an image and breed name. Each breed links to the third view.
**Listed as "nice to have": Search field to filter breeds.**

## Third view (breed gallery)
- Shows a gallery with all photos of a specific breed.
**Paginated results, 8 per page.**
**URL input field and copy-to-clipboard button.**
**Link to Wikpedia breed page at the very bottom. (Again, results may vary depending on visitor's country.**

# Styling
All the styling was done using Styled Components. The color palette I picked is #de1b76 (GWI's Magenta) and #fdecda, combined with black and white.

# Final Thoughts
I had a lot of fun with this challenge and learned new things, as I had, for example, never used Styled Components or React Paginate.

I look forward to work at GWI!
